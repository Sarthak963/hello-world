                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENT

1. LOCATION. During the  Term  (as  defined  in Section 6 (a) below), NAI shall       provide  the  following  marketing considerations to Co-Host:

  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-Host shall be  permitted  to  maintain  on the           Online Service Page (as  defined  in Part 2 of Exhibit "A") of the           Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit "B" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit "B" or as the           parties may mutually  agree  upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to Internet locations  specified  by the Co-Host (the           "Destination") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods           (hereinafter  defined  )) may be  sold  . The web pages at the Destination           shall be  maintained  in accordance with the requirements of this           Agreement,  including  without limitation, Section 2 hereof. "Competitor's Goods" as  used  herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit "C" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not  contain  any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods;  provided            that the Destination will  link  to the Co-Host Site (which will  sell            Competitor's Goods). (b)  Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of           software products ("Software") at the Originating Locations. The            preceding  sentence shall not  prohibit  NAI from (i)  reselling  Software            including  NAI Goods (hereinafter  defined  ) from the McAfee Mall; (ii)            referencing  and  linking  to sites of strategic partners (other than           competitors of Co-Host  listed  on Part 2 of Exhibit "C") which may also           be  involved  in the resale of Software from such sites;  provided  that           no Software may be  purchased  on the page of such site which is  linked            to any Originating Location and further  provided  that the references           and  links  to the sites of strategic partners shall not be  placed  on           the Online Service Page; and (iii)  advertising  Software with banners,           buttons and other forms of online advertising;  provided  that any link           from such advertising  takes  the end user to the publisher of the           Software and not a reseller of Goods (other than Co-Host). For           example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software           program may  link  back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not           the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is  reselling  the           program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may  co   -   host  a           comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will            obtain  a  written  covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will           present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of           Co-Host will  require  removal or alteration of presentations by such           co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably  deems  to           be non-neutral;  provided  , however, that, notwithstanding the           foregoing, Co-Host may be the  featured  or most prominent Software           reseller on any such service. (c)  Short  Term  Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14)  days             following  release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases           (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of  existing  NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the           exclusive online seller of any such

                                    3    4

       release  released  during the  Term  . "NAI Goods" as  used  herein shall           mean retail desktop software products offered by NAI under the           "McAfee" brand or other NAI owned brand, which NAI makes available for           resale through distributors and resellers via the Internet. (d)  Reference Site. Co-Host may  refer  to the Originating Locations as a           Co-Host customer location and to NAI as a Co-Host customer hereunder            provided  all such references shall be subject to the prior review and           approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably  withheld  . (e)  Links to Online Service Page. Any end user  accessing  the principal           URLs of NAI (e.g., mcafee.com, cybermedia.com, pgp.com, tis.com) shall           be  taken  to the Online Service Page. Any end user  accessing  a "buy"           button on any of the Originating Locations shall be  taken  to the           Online Service Page. NAI shall not  sell  retail desktop consumer           products,  including  without limitation, NAI Goods from the NAI           Internet Sites (other than the McAfee Mall). NAI  reserves  the right to  change  the URL of the Originating Locations           from time to time and  agrees  to  give  Co-Host as much notice of any           such change as is practicable. 2. MARKETING AND SALES. (a)  Placement of Order. In consideration of the Co-Hosting Fee set forth           in Part 3 of Exhibit "A", NAI shall  provide  the marketing           consideration  identified  in Section 1 during the  Term  of this





       Agreement. (b)  Advertising Materials; Destination Operation. Co-Host shall  provide  to           NAI artwork and text materials with respect to the advertisement of           the Destination at the Originating Locations. Such artwork and           materials must be non-infringing, inoffensive, accurate, truthful and           otherwise  comply  with all applicable laws. Co-Host shall  comply  with           all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the           Destination,  including  without limitation, requirements  regarding  the           confidentiality of information  concerning  end users. NAI  retains  the           right, but not the obligation, to  disapprove  or  remove  any           advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably  deems  illegal,           inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the           Originating Sites, without the consent of Co-Host. (c)  Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive,           non-transferable, royalty-free license during the  term  of this           Agreement to  use  the trademarks, service marks and trade names of           Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods           from the Originating Locations,  provided  that NAI complies with the           terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as  defined            below). Co-Host reserves the right to  terminate  the  foregoing  right,           after  giving  NAI notice and opportunity to  cure  the allegedly harmful           use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such           trademarks, service marks and trade names  harms  the business, image or           goodwill of Co-Host. 4    5

  (d)  Limited Duty of Promotion. NAI shall have no duty or obligation to           advertise or  promote  the Goods, other than as set forth in this           Section 2. Except as expressly set forth herein ( including  , without           limitation, as set forth in this Section 2(d)), NAI  does  not,           expressly or impliedly, guaranty or  warrant  any results or level of           sales or customer leads to Co-Host. NAI  reserves  the right to  cease            publication of the Originating Locations for brief periods from time           to time for maintenance or other purposes;  provided  that the           Originating Locations will  comply  with the same "Uptime Requirements"            specified  with respect to the " Managed  Site" in the Web Site Services           Agreement. (e)  Marketing Promotions. During the  Term  , Co-Host and NAI will regularly            discuss  and  implement  mutually  agreed  upon jointly  funded  marketing           promotions. NAI and Co-Host hereby  agree  that the marketing promotions           set forth on Exhibit "D" hereto will be  implemented  as set forth on           Exhibit "D". (f)  Distribution of Physical Products. NAI  grants  to Co -   Host  the right to            distribute  physical copies of NAI's Goods to  end  users  ordering  from           the Managed Site, the Destination or Beyond.com upon the terms set           forth in Exhibit "E"  attached  hereto and  made  a part hereof. 3. PAYMENT AND RECORDS. (a)  Fees. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, Co-Host shall  pay            to NAI the amount  designated  in Part 3 of Exhibit "A" as the           Co-Hosting Fee upon the schedule set forth in such Part. (b)  Payment Terms. Except as set forth in such Part 3 of Exhibit "A",           payments from Co-Host to NAI shall be due thirty (30)  days  from the           date of invoice. All payments will be  made  in United States dollars,           free of any taxes then  currently  applicable, at the address  designated            above by NAI. Late payments shall  bear  interest at the lesser of: (i)           the maximum rate  permitted  by law, and (ii) the rate of 1.5% per  month            from the due date until  paid  . 4. EQUITABLE RELIEF. Each party  acknowledges  that any breach of its      obligations under this Agreement with respect to the proprietary rights or      confidential information of the other party will  cause  the other party      irreparable injury for which there are inadequate remedies at law, and      therefore such other party will be  entitled  to  equitable  relief in addition      to all other remedies  provided  by this Agreement or available at law. 5.
