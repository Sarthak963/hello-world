  Study specific documents ("Study Orders") as  agreed  upon by the Parties. This Agreement shall  apply  to all Studies set out in the Study Orders  performed  by MD Anderson and the MD Anderson principal investigator(s) responsible for the performance of such Studies ("Principal Investigator(s)") upon execution of Study Orders during the  term  of this Agreement. Each Study Order shall be substantially in the form  attached  as Exhibit III to this Agreement and shall  detail  the specifics of the Study to be  performed  under such Study Order  including  , without limitation, (i) the detailed Protocol or workscope, (ii) the Principal Investigator and (iii)  identify  any project-specific resources or support  provided  by Adaptimmune. In the event of any conflict of terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall  govern  , unless the Study Order specifically and expressly  supersedes  this Agreement with respect to a specific  term  , and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific  term  . If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms  contained  in a Protocol or workscope and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol or workscope shall  govern  and  control  with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order in that order shall  govern  and  control  with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters. 1.3 Adaptimmune  agrees  to  commit  funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the  term  ("Alliance Funding"). The JSC may  allocate  and/or  re   -   allocate  funds to Studies as necessary and  agreed  by JSC. The basic per patient estimate for Clinical Studies is as  follows  : for  screening  Clinical Studies: $***, for long  term  follow-up Clinical Studies: $*** and for other Clinical Studies: $***. If the Parties  extend  the  term  by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall  negotiate  in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended  term  . In the event a Study is  terminated  early, then in relation to any funds  allocated  to such Study, the Parties shall promptly  discuss  and  agree  upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is  approved  by the JSC, and that will be  funded  by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be  allocated  to studies, research or tests  agreed  by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with  agreed  milestones relevant to such  agreed  studies, research or tests. The Parties  understand  that the compensation being  paid  to MD Anderson under this Agreement  constitutes  the fair market value of the services to be  provided  hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall  seek  or  accept  reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures  supplied  by or  paid  for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson  acknowledges  that Adaptimmune may be  obligated  to  disclose  all payments  made  hereunder,  including  the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be  required  under Applicable Law,  including  the Physician Payments Sunshine Act,  passed  as Section 6002 of the  2010  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent  required  by Applicable Laws,  agrees  to  keep  and  maintain  relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request,  provide  such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent  required  for Adaptimmune to  comply  with its legally  required  reporting obligations. MD Anderson  consents  to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is  required  for Adaptimmune to  comply  with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall  ensure  that the Principal Investigator  provides  in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to  comply  with any disclosure requirements to the extent  required  by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 54,  including  but not  limited  to, any information  required  to be  disclosed  in connection with any financial relationship between Adaptimmune and the Principal Investigators and sub-investigators  involved  in the Study, as well as any immediate family members thereof.

  No amounts  paid  under this Agreement are  intended  to be for, nor shall they be  construed  as, an offer or payment  made  in exchange for any explicit or implicit agreement to  purchase  ,  prescribe  ,  recommend  , or  provide  a favorable formulary status, for any Adaptimmune product or service. Any such compensation will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be  determined  in a manner that  takes  into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise  generated  between the Parties for which payment may be  made  in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each  confirm  that in  entering  into this Agreement they have not  accepted  any bribes or illegal inducements to  enter  into this Agreement or to  perform  any Study and will not  accept  any bribe or illegal inducement or  offer  any bribe or illegal inducement in the performance of or for the performance of any Study whether during or after the termination or expiry of this Agreement. 1.4 The nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the Studies shall be due and payable to MD Anderson  according  to the schedule  outlined  in Table 2 in Exhibit II. The JSC  retains  the right to  prioritize  and  replace  Studies as necessary subject to Section 1.6. 1.5 The Parties will  establish  a Joint Steering Committee ("JSC") of equal representation,  comprised  of three (3) representatives (employees, directors or consultants who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) from each Party, with the representatives of each Party collectively  having  one vote on all matters to be  decided  upon by the JSC. Each Party can  appoint  and  replace  its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely  written  notice to the other Party. 1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per  year  will be  conducted  in person or by videoconference ( including  the  kick  -off meeting). The JSC will  decide  on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune  exercising  one vote each  provided  , however, that no action may lawfully be  taken  at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party ( including  for this purpose any proxy representative  appointed  as  provided  below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to  attend  a meeting, he or she may  appoint  , in writing, a proxy to  participate  and  vote  in his or her stead. Decisions may also be  made  by electronic mail,  provided  such electronic mail is  provided  by at least two representatives from Adaptimmune and MD Anderson and such electronic mail is  acknowledged  to be  received  by the recipient. Although decision will be  made  by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, ***           . 1.7 The main task of the JSC will be to  oversee  the Alliance. In order to  achieve  the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will  oversee  each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will  provide  technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for  monitoring  progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be  invited  by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics  require  so,  provided  that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non- use  at least as strict as Section 5 below. In the event a Study is  terminated  early or  does  not  initiate  , the Parties shall promptly  replace  that Study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties. Once  agreed  by the JSC, such replacement study will be  funded  by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with  agreed  milestones for such replacement study. ***  Portions of this page have been  omitted  pursuant to a request for Confidential Treatment and  filed  separately with the Commission. 3





  1.8 In addition, the JSC will be responsible for  coordinating  resolution of problems  arising  in the Studies or in the Alliance as a whole. In the event of any matter to which the JSC cannot  reach  resolution, or in the event of any dispute  arising  as to any matter subject to JSC responsibility and  save  where Adaptimmune has the  deciding  vote in accordance with Section 1.6 above, such matter or dispute will be  escalated  to executive management of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune for good faith resolution. Both Parties shall  use  all reasonable efforts to  resolve  any matter or dispute on a timely basis. 1.9 MD Anderson  represents  and certifies that neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator will, directly or indirectly,  offer  or  pay  , or  authorize  an offer or payment of, any money or anything of value to any Public Official ( defined  below) or public entity, with the knowledge or intent that the payment,  promise  or gift, in whole or in part, will be  made  in order to improperly  influence  an official act or decision that will  assist  Adaptimmune in  securing  an improper advantage or in  obtaining  or  retaining  business or in  directing  business to any person or entity in relation to the Study. In addition to other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, Adaptimmune may  terminate  the  affected  Study Order if MD Anderson  breaches  any of the representations or certifications  contained  in this Section or if Adaptimmune  learns  that improper payments are being or have been  made  to any Public Official by MD Anderson or Investigator. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Public Official" means any officer or employee of a government, a public international organization or any department or agency thereof, or any person acting in an official capacity, including, for a public agency or enterprise; and any political party or party official, or any candidate for public office. Adaptimmune  acknowledges  and  agrees  that MD Anderson is an agency of the State of Texas, and its investigator, employees, and officers  do   constitute  a Public Official, as  used  in this paragraph, for purposes of this Section. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.9, nothing in this Section shall  constitute  a limitation on MD Anderson's ability to  operate  within its legal capacity as an agency of the State of Texas, nor shall anything in this Agreement  require  MD Anderson to  violate  any law or to  refrain  from  complying  with any law applicable to MD Anderson. 2. Responsibilities and Compliance   2.1 Each Clinical Study shall be subject to review and approval of the Study protocol ("Protocol") as  required  by MD Anderson's Institutional Review Board ("Institutional Review Board" or "IRB") and/or any relevant authorities prior to commencement of the Study as may be  required  in order to  comply  with Applicable Laws. 2.2 The scope of the Study to be  performed  shall be set forth in the Protocol(s) or workscope  referenced  in the Study Order, which shall be  incorporated  by reference into such Study Order. These Protocol(s)/workscope shall be  considered  final after being  agreed  to by MD Anderson and Adaptimmune and, for Clinical Studies,  including  approval by MD Anderson's IRB. The Principal Investigator for a Clinical Study shall  submit  the Protocol and reports of the ongoing conduct of the Clinical Study to the IRB as  required  by the IRB,  obtain   written  approval from the IRB, and  inform  the IRB of Study closure.
