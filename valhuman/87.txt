COLLABORATION AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is  made  this 1st  day  of  April ,  2007  ("Effective  Date  "), by and between INSTITUTE OF GRASSLAND AND  ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH ("IGER"), a company  limited  by guarantee,  registered  in England No. 473456 and a  registered  Charity No. 272150,   having  an office at Plas Gogerddan, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, SY23 3EB, United Kingdom and CERES, INC. ("CERES"), a Delaware corporation,   having  an office at  1535  Rancho Conejo Blvd., Thousand Oaks, California 91320, United States of America. WHEREAS, the Parties  wish  to  establish  a research program for  undertaking  specific, collaborative projects after the Effective  Date  , to further the  scientific research and commercial objectives of CERES as well as the scientific research objectives of IGER;

WHEREAS, the research programs  contemplated  by this Agreement and its schedules are consistent with and in furtherance of IGER research  programs;

WHEREAS, CERES and IGER  recognize  that rights to intellectual property  conceived  or  reduced  to  practice  in the performance of the Parties'  collaboration can be a strong incentive for CERES to  risk  money and other resources  needed  to  develop  proprietary products for wide  commercialization;

The Parties  acknowledge  and  agree  that the RESEARCH  PROJECTS will  involve  the contributions, whether financial or otherwise, of both Parties. The specific terms and respective obligations of the  Parties for each RESEARCH PROJECT will be  negotiated  by the Parties and  reflected  in a schedule ("SCHEDULE")  signed  by authorized  representatives of both Parties. Any such fully  executed  SCHEDULE shall  become  a part of this Agreement and subject to the terms of this  Agreement. Each Party shall diligently  perform  its activities in any  given  RESEARCH PROJECT. 1.2 All rights in property, tangible or intangible,  used  in the RESEARCH PROJECTS shall  remain  with the Party  providing  such property, unless  otherwise  agreed  between the Parties in this Agreement, a SCHEDULE or a separate agreement. 1.3 RESEARCH PROJECTS will  relate  to crop species  defined  in EXHIBIT A to this Agreement ("COLLABORATION CROPS"). 1.4 Each SCHEDULE will at least  contain  the following:
