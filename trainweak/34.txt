In the event of such a termination, Supplier shall  continue  performance of any nonterminated portion of the Purchase Order, or any nonterminated Purchase Orders, and the quantity of Ingredient  ordered  and so  terminated  shall be  deducted  against any relevant Master Purchase Commitment. 2.6 PNC or its  contracted  third-party auditors may  enter  and  audit  / inspect  Supplier's facilities where the Ingredients are  produced  , stored,  packaged  or otherwise  processed  [***] unless food safety is at issue or PNC has a good faith reason to  believe  the Ingredients are being  stored  ,  packaged  , or  processed

If correction of the deficiency cannot be  affected  within [***] of such notice, then Supplier shall promptly  notify  PNC with its plan to  correct  the deficiency  including  an  estimated  schedule. If the deficiency cannot be  corrected  within [***], unless otherwise  agreed  , then PNC shall have the right to  terminate  any Purchase Orders then outstanding, along with any Master Purchase Commitment related thereto. 3 Business Continuity/Continuous Supply Assurances.
