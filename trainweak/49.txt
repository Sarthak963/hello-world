   Cargill Confidential   - 1 -   * Confidential treatment  requested  

  A. Cargill has  developed  a yeast strain  designated  CB1 ("CB1") for  fermenting  dextrose and/or  mixed  sugar streams and related research  tools for  modifying  CB1,which are  protected  by Licensed Patents (as  defined  in Section 2.5 below). B. Bioamber  desires  to  engage  Cargill to further  develop  or  modify  CB1 with the goal of  fermenting  dextrose and/or  mixed  sugar streams to   produce  succinic acid and salts thereof. C. The Parties  desire  to  grant  each other certain rights to  use  the further  developed  or  modified  CB1 as well as other technology that is   developed  in the course of the work as  provided  in this Development Agreement for research purposes only. 1. Scope of Work Plan  1.1 Cargill  agrees  to  perform  the services to  develop  or  modify  CB1 to  produce  succinic acid and salts thereof  using  dextrose ( defined  as  glucose) and/or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock ("Work Plan"). The Work Plan is more fully  described  in Exhibit A, which is hereby   incorporated  by reference into this Development Agreement. CB1 that has been further  developed  or  modified  (or the like) under the Work  Plan shall be  referred  to as "Modified CB1". Any changes to the Work Plan must be in writing and  signed  by both Cargill and Bioamber and  may be subject to incremental fees  depending  on resource requirements. 1.2 In  agreeing  to  perform  the Work Plan, Cargill  represents  and warrants that:

  1.2.1 Cargill has the capability, experience, and means necessary to perform the Work Plan, and the Work Plan will be performed using  personnel, equipment, and material qualified and suitable to perform the Work Plan requested;

  1.2.2 Cargill will  provide  properly  trained  and  informed  personnel, and Cargill will be solely responsible for the negligent acts, errors and  omissions of its employees, subcontractors, and agents and for any other person  performing  services under this Development  Agreement at the direct request of Cargill;

  1.2.3 Cargill will  perform  the Work Plan in a workmanlike manner with reasonable skill and care ordinarily  exercised  by members of the  profession  practicing  under similar conditions and in accordance with accepted industry practices and professional guidelines;

  1.2.4 Subject to Section 13.1, Cargill has in effect and will  maintain  in effect all permits, licenses and other authorizations necessary to   perform  the Work Plan; and



1.2.5 No other party has rights to its services as  described  in the Work Plan, and that a work assignment from any third party shall not be   accepted  , or work by Cargill aloneshall not be  conducted  , to  develop  CB1 or other microorganisms that will be  used  to (a) directly   produce  succinic acid and salts thereof, or (b) indirectly  produce  succinic acid and salts thereof (for example, Cargill may  develop   microorganisms to  produce  precursors of succinic acid, such as fumaric acid and malic acid, so long as such precursors are not   converted  to succinic acid, such as by chemical modification), for the  Term  (as  defined  in Section 10.1) of this Development  Agreement. For purposes of clarity, and as examples, Cargill may  sell  dextrose as fermentation feedstock to third parties, who may   use  such dextrose to  produce  succinic acid; also, Cargill may  modify  starches to  make  succinic acid starch derivatives. 2. Fees and Milestones   2.1 Bioamber shall  pay  Cargill Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000.00) within thirty (30)  days  of the execution of this  Development Agreement. 2.2 In addition to the payment in Section 2.1, Bioamber shall  pay  Cargill a total of [***] U.S. Dollars ($[***] per  year  per full-time equivalent  (FTE) person to  perform  the Work Plan, and Cargill will  make  available up to [***] FTE persons per  year  to  perform  the work as  outlined  in  the Work Plan. Such total is subject to change  based  on an  annual  review of the needs and requirements of the Work Plan. The actual  number of FTEs  assigned  at any  given  time will be a function of the Work Plan and will be subject to agreement amongst the Parties. In  addition, Bioamber will  pay  for reasonable expenses  incurred  by Cargill,  including  travel. Cargill shall  cover  ordinary and customary [***]. Cargill shall  submit  to Bioamber a  monthly  invoice for costs  owed  by Bioamber,  accompanied  by a report  summarizing  Cargill's activities in  relation to actual hours  worked  and expenses  incurred  . Bioamber will  pay  Cargill's costs within thirty (30)  days  of receipt of invoice and   supporting  documentation. Bioamber shall have the right to  audit  Cargill time sheets from time to time. Such audit shall  occur   once per year   during reasonable business hours by an independent third party  agreed  to by both parties, who shall be under obligations of  confidentiality.

2.3 Bioamber shall also  pay  Cargill within thirty (30)  days  of  achieving  each of the milestones  summarized  below and more fully  described  in the  Work Plan  found  in Exhibit A. For purposes of clarity, payment is  triggered  [***]. Further, each of the Milestones and Target Dates may be   changed   according  to the needs of the Work Plan and upon  written  agreement by the parties. Milestone   Target  Date    Payment  Milestone 1: Proof of Concept    12 months  after Effective  Date    US $250,000.00 Milestone 2: CB1 Strain Development    30 months  after Effective  Date    US $300,000.00 Milestone 3: CB1 Strain Optimization    42 months  after Effective  Date    US $500,000.00

2.4 Missed Milestones. 2.4.1 In the event Cargill  does  not  achieve  a  given  Milestone  provided  in Section 2.3 by the Target  Date   listed  in Section 2.3 or  modified   Milestone and  modified  Target  Date  as  agreed  to by the Parties, and subsequently  achieves  such milestone as per the criteria   described  in Exhibit A, the payment for such  missed  milestone shall be due [***] and the amount due shall be [***] for every [***]  beyond the Target  Date  . The Target  Date  for subsequent Milestones will be  adjusted  to  reflect  the date on which the Milestone was  actually  achieved  . If a subsequent Milestone is  achieved  by the original Target  Date   listed  in Section 2.3, Bioamber will  pay  Cargill  the amount [***]. For purposes of clarity and as examples, if Milestones 1 and 2 were not  delivered  by the Target Dates, but  Milestone 3 is  delivered  by or before the Target  Date  , then the total payments due to Cargill at that time would be [***] (a total  payment of $[***]). Another example is if [***], the payment due at that time would be a total of $[***]. 2.4.2 In the event Cargill  does  not  achieve  a  given  Milestone  provided  in Section 2.3 by the Target  Date   listed  in Section 2.3 or  modified   Milestone and  modified  Target  Date  as  agreed  to by the Parties, and Bioamber  decides  to  commercialize  Modified CB1, any  outstanding milestone payments shall immediately  become  due such that the total payment due Cargill under this Development  Agreement  equals  One Million Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,050,000.00).

In the event Cargill (i) is unable to  achieve  a  given  milestone  described  in Section 2.3 by the Target  Date  , or (ii)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to  obtain  a license during the  term  of this Development  Agreement to the patent applications and patents  listed  in Exhibit B ( including  any continuations,  continued  prosecutions, continuations- in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively "Licensed Patents"), the tool kit  listed  in Exhibit C  ("Licensed Tool Kit"), and Cargill Improvements if any (as  defined  in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary  consideration ("Research License"). Except for financial terms  paid  by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be  offered  to  Bioamber at [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of CB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts  thereof  using  dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock. The Research License shall be  provided  to Bioamber only, with no rights  to sublicense and with no "have  made  " rights. Notwithstanding the  preceding  , Bioamber will be  permitted  to  outsource  development work  as  outlined  in the Work Plan and  according  to the Research License to third parties that have been  approved  by Cargill, and such approval  shall not be unreasonably  withheld  . In  considering  whether or not to  outsource  such development work to third parties, the Parties   recognize  that it is in their mutual interest to  protect  CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as  defined  in Section 4.1), and  Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are  defined  under the Commercial License Agreement) and, therefore, the Parties shall   undertake  joint evaluations of third parties who have been  identified  by Bioamber to  perform  such development work,  including  , for  example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will  occur  , and whether or not such  third parties have similar  guiding  principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill's Guiding Principles and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property  is  attached  as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be  conducted  by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill's intellectual  property is at an unacceptable risk as  determined  by Cargill  based  on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions  of such Research License shall be  negotiated  between the Parties and shall  include  the terms  described  in this Section 2.5 and terms   addressing  ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property  developed  . Further, this Development Agreement shall  serve  as the  framework for the Research License. 2.6 Technology Transfer. In the event Milestone 3 is  achieved  , Cargill will  provide  up to [***] to  assist  in a successful transfer of the Modified  CB1 technology to Bioamber in order to  allow  subsequent scale-up at the same FTE rate set forth in Section 2.2. For clarity, [***] per FTE  per  year   equals  US$[***] for this technology transfer). Cargill Confidential   - 5 -   * Confidential treatment  requested  

2.7 Scale-Up.  Following  the successful technology transfer, upon request by Bioamber and subject to Cargill's availability of appropriate  resources, Cargill will  enter  at its sole discretion into a services agreement with Bioamber to  assist  in the fermentation scale-up of  using   Modified CB1  obtained  under Milestones 2 and 3 for  producing  succinic acid and salts thereof at a single Bioamber facility or a facility   designated  by Bioamber. Cargill shall  invoice  Bioamber [***] U.S. Dollars (US$[***]) per man- day   provided  , not inclusive of taxes or other  governmental fees, and further  adjusted  for inflation at the time it  goes  into effect. Cargill shall have no obligation to  perform  scale-up work  at Cargill facilities. 3. Alternative Feedstock. Bioamber also  desires  the right to further  develop  CB1 to  utilize  cellulosic biomass as the fermentation feedstock. Cargill hereby  grants  Bioamber the option to  modify  or  convert  the Work Plan to  include  the development or modification of CB1 capable of   fermenting  such cellulosic feedstock ("Modified Work Plan"). If such option is  exercised  , (a) the terms and conditions of this Development  Agreement shall  apply  to the Modified Work Plan except (i) new, additional up-front and milestone payments shall  apply  as  provided   below, and (ii) any development work  performed  under the Modified Work Plan will be at a FTE rate which will be equivalent to the FTE rate   provided  in Section 2.2 above and further  adjusted  for inflation at the time it  goes  into effect; and (b) the commercial license  attached  as  Exhibit D shall be  expanded  to  include  the  resulting  strain  developed  out of the Modified Work Plan with no additional change in the  financial terms.
