The University and/or Principal Investigator together with ArTara and the CRO will  conduct  the Project in accordance with the Project Plan and will  use  all reasonable endeavors consistent with their expertise to successfully  complete  the Project. It is the goal of the Project to  use  the Program Data as clinical support for Product Regulatory Filings and to  gain  approval to  commercialize  the Product for the Indication in the Territory. 2.2 Project Plan. The Project Plan as  approved  by each of the Parties may be  modified  or  amended  only upon mutual agreement of each of the Parties. The Project will  consist  of three phases: (a) Phase I: University and/or Principal Investigator will  provide  access to the Program Data to ArTara and the CRO at the University's facilities. ArTara and the CRO will be  allowed  to  make  complete copies of the original Program Data for the purposes of off-site data entry and storage, all as and only to the extent  needed  to  support  ArTara's efforts to  accomplish  the Project. University will  provide  ArTara and CRO the opportunity to  examine  the originals of medical records and  supporting  records for the Program Data at the University during normal business hours and at mutually agreeable times. University and Principal Investigator will also  provide  to ArTara contact information for other  participating  investigators and research sites that have  contributed  data to the Program. University will  retain  all Program Data for the sooner to  occur  of a New Drug Application (NDA) for the Product being  approved  or ten (10)  years  from the Effective  Date  . ArTara will  bear  any costs  related  to necessary long- term  on or off-site storage of the Program Data, medical records and/or  supporting  records. ArTara  understands  that separate engagement agreements may be  required  by  collaborating  third party entities and  associated  principal investigators and University will  assist  ArTara in  obtaining  such agreements. It is  understood  that the goal of Phase I is a feasibility analysis of the Program Data to  support  Regulatory Filings in the United States. (b) Phase II: University  recognizes  that because of ArTara's unfamiliarity with the Program Data database, assistance from the Principal Investigator and other research and medical employees of the University may from time to time be  needed  for ArTara to  query  and  analyze  the Program Data database as  needed  to  achieve  successful presentation to applicable Regulatory Authorities and submission of Regulatory Filings. ArTara will  endeavor  to  minimize  University resources  required  during Phase II. The goal of Phase II will be to  compile  the Project Documentation. (c) Phase III: CRO will  convert  Program Data to  eCTD  format for submission to Regulatory Authorities. University  recognizes  that ArTara may  receive  specific data requests from Regulatory Authorities in connection with ArTara's presentations of Program Data to  support  Regulatory Filings. University will  assist  ArTara in  responding  to such requests for data or access to  source  data from Regulatory Authorities. ArTara  agrees  to  notify  University of such requests as soon as is practicable. The goal of Phase III will be filing of a BLA  based  on Project Documentation and response to Regulatory Authorities. 4

(d) Phase IV Optional: Upon mutual  written  agreement of University and ArTara, ArTara may  sponsor  , and University may  conduct  , new Product or Product- related  clinical studies (for example,  follow  -up studies) to  support  the goal of the Project or as may be useful for  gaining  or  maintaining  Regulatory Approvals for the Product for the Indication. Any such studies will be at the sole discretion of each Party subject to terms and conditions to be mutually  agreed  upon in agreements separate from this Agreement. Richard Smith, MD will be  given  first consideration as a principal investigator for all new Product or Product- related clinical studies, in addition to other sites  provided  final site selection will be  based  on the best interest of the Project. (e) Phase V: Publication:  Collected  data from the Project will be  used  to  write  a paper by the University and/or Principal Investigator (the "Publication") as a follow up to the publication in  2009  (Smith MC, Zimmerman MB, Burke DK, Bauman NM, Sato Y, Smith RJ; OK-432 Collaborative Study Group. Efficacy and safety of OK-432 immunotherapy of lymphatic malformations. Laryngoscope. 2009Jan;119(1):107-15. doi: 10.1002/lary.20041. PubMed PMID: 19117316) . ( the "Publication"). The Publication will be in accordance with the terms in Article 5 herein. 2.3 Project Management. During the  term  of this Agreement, the Principal Investigator and and/or his authorized representative and ArTara  authorized  representatives will  meet  as necessary to  consult  with one another and  discuss  the progress and results of the Project and any modifications to the Project Plan. Consultation by either Party shall be by means of personal visits, correspondence and telephone calls, all as appear reasonable and necessary and are mutually agreed upon by the Principal Investigator and ArTara. ARTICLE THREE FUNDING AND PAYMENT 3.1 Funding. During the  term  of the Project in accordance with the Project Plan, ArTara will  provide  thirty thousand dollars (US $30,000) per  year  in funding for the Project,  taking  into consideration the time  spent  by University employees  required  for the Project. The Parties  agree  to  discuss  in good faith potential additional funding  required  for completion of the Project as applicable and necessary. 3.2 Approval Milestone  based  on Data Value: Within forty-five (45)  days  of an approval of the TARA-002 BLA by the FDA, ArTara will  pay  a one- time approval milestone to University pursuant to the usefulness of the Program Data in TARA-002's BLA filing, as set forth below: Official Feedback from FDA  regarding  the Program Data Milestone [â¦***â¦] $[â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦] $[â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦] $[â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦] [â¦***â¦]
