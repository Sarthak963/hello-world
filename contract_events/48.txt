6

                                    -5-

   own discretion,  give  partial shipments to large orders. In no event will       the Company be  obligated  to  provide  Products to the Agent in excess of one       hundred and twenty percent (120%) of any maximum quantity  specified  in the       applicable Business Plan;

         (b)  provide  to the Agent's field sales personnel at least four (4)       hours of initial Products sales and marketing training, and Agent        telesales  personnel at least one (1) hour of initial Product sales and       marketing training, and such supplemental training, if any, as the Company       may  deem  appropriate, in each case, at such times and locations as may be       mutually  agreed  upon by the Company and the Agent. (c)  supply  such literature, ad reprints and other promotional aids       and furnish Agent with other information that in the opinion of the       Company may be helpful in the sale of  listed  Product(s). (d)  compensate  the Agent through a discount of eight (8) percent off       of the  current  price of the Product times the total  monthly  units  shipped        at that price to the Customer in the Agent's Territory  excluding  any       taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges  incurred  by the Company. The       Company will  compensate  the Agent an additional two (2) percent through a       discount off of the  current  price or promotional price of the Product        times  the total  monthly  units  shipped  at that price to the Customer        excluding  any taxes, and/or shipping and handling charges  incurred  by the       Company, so as to  compensate  the Agent's sales representatives. Therefore,       a total of ten (10) percent discount off of the  current  price list or       promotional price times the total  monthly  units  shipped  at that price to       the Customer will be  applied  as payment for services from the Agent        including  , but not  limited  to, the promotion, sales, and collection of       payment from the Customer for Product  shipped  by the Company. In addition       the Company will  compensate  the Agent quarterly an additional two (2)       percent commission (incentive), exclusive of taxes, and  /or  shipping and       handling charges  incurred  by the Company,  based  upon the attainment of       mutually  agreed  upon quarterly goals. One (1) percent of this incentive is       additional compensation for the Agent, and one (1) percent is for       additional compensation of the Agency sales force. In the event the Agent        fails  to  achieve  these goals during any  given  quarter yet is able to        achieve  the overall  annual  goals, then the Agent will  receive  the       incentive commission for  that quarter  at the conclusion of the fiscal        year  . These goals are  outlined  in exhibit B. (e) will  replace  , any unit of Product to the Customer which has        outdated  ( provided  the Product is not  outdated  more than ninety (90)  days  )       with equal Product. 7
