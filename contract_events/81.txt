For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be  considered         in the care, custody or control of a Party from the time it is  tendered         to it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of        its delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as  intended  . For        greater certainty, a Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight        is  damaged  solely as a result of improper packing. 6.2    A Party shall, in the event of loss, damage or delay to Freight while in        its care, custody or control, immediately  notify  the other Party of the         loss or damage,  carry  out an investigation of the incident to  determine         the cause of such loss, damage or delay and shall within

All costs  associated         with such investigation shall be the responsibility of such Party if the        loss, damage or delay was due to the acts or omissions or those of its        employees, agents or those for whom in law its is responsible;        otherwise, the costs shall be  shared  equally by the Parties  hereto  . 6.3    A party shall, for any loss, damage or delay to Freight while in its        care, custody or control, forthwith pay to the other Party the actual        damages  suffered  by such other Party. Such liability shall not  exceed  the        other Party's contractual liability to its customers. The Parties         acknowledge  that their contract of carriage with their customers  provides         that liability for loss, damage or delay,  including  liability for        consequential loss, is  limited  to Four Dollars and Forty One Cents        ($4.41) per kilogram or Two Dollars ($2.00) per pound unless a higher        value has been  declared  for insurance purposes. 7.0    SET-OFF

If a Party  fails  to  pay          following  presentation of  supporting  documentation then the other Party        shall have the right to  deduct  the amount of such claim, loss or damage        from any monies due or  becoming  due to the first Party by the second        Party.
